This module challenge, we used Visual Basic for Applications, better known as VBA, to add even more analytical power to Excel. VBA is a programming language that interacts directly with Excel worksheets and cells, allowing us to write scripts to automate simple tasks. It also allows us to write complicated scripts to perform complex analyses, which we wouldn't be able to do with Excel alone. In the context of VBA, we learned the fundamental building blocks of programming languages. Learning to code is essentially learning how to deconstruct a problem and translate the solution into simple instructions. Excel helped you start thinking about data differently, VBA will help start thinking about how to programmatically analyze the data.
